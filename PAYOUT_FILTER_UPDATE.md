# 🎯 92%+ Payout Filter Update Summary

## Overview

The OTC Signal Bot has been enhanced with comprehensive payout rate filtering to ensure only high-reward trading pairs (92%+ payout) are used for signal generation.

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### New Configuration Parameters

```python
# Payout Rate Threshold - Only trade pairs with 92%+ payout
MIN_PAYOUT_RATE = 0.92         # Minimum payout rate required (92%)

```
