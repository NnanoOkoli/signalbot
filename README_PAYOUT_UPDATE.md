# 🎯 92%+ Payout Filter Update - COMPLETED ✅

## 🚀 Update Summary

Your OTC Signal Bot has been successfully updated with comprehensive payout rate filtering to ensure only high-reward trading pairs (92%+ payout) are used for signal generation.

## ✅ What Was Updated

### 1. Configuration (`config.py`)

- Added `MIN_PAYOUT_RATE = 0.92` (92% minimum payout)
- Added `PAYOUT_CHECK_ENABLED = True` (enable/disable feature)

### 2. Pocket Option API (`pocket_option_api.py`)

- **`get_asset_info(asset)`**: Get detailed asset information
- **`get_asset_payout_rate(asset, expiry_time)`**: Get specific payout rates
- **`get_high_payout_assets(min_payout)`**: Get all high-payout assets

### 3. Bot Logic (`otc_multitf_pocket_bot.py`)

- **Pre-filtering**: Pairs filtered by payout rate before signal generation
- **Real-time validation**: Each signal verified against payout threshold
- **Dual criteria**: Both profit potential AND payout rate must meet thresholds
- **Enhanced messages**: Signals now include payout rate information

## 🎯 How It Works

### Signal Generation Flow

1. **Pair Filtering**: Only pairs with 92%+ payout are considered
2. **Technical Analysis**: Signals must score 97+ points
3. **Payout Verification**: Actual payout rate checked for each signal
4. **Profit Validation**: 92%+ profit potential required
5. **Signal Generation**: Only if ALL criteria are met
